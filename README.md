# 🧠 Job Research AI — Automated Job Ad Extraction & Insights

A fully automated pipeline that crawls job advertisement webpages, extracts structured information using LLMs, and generates insights and reports.  
Built for fast, accurate, and scalable analysis of job market trends.

---

## 🌟 Motivation

Researching roles such as *AI Engineer* or *Data Analyst* requires manually reading large numbers of job advertisements. This is slow and inefficient because:

- Job ads have **no consistent format**
- Key information (skills, responsibilities, salary, experience) is often missing or scattered
- Traditional scraping and parsing techniques **struggle with unstructured text**

To solve this, the project uses **LLMs**, **Crawl4AI**, **Pydantic**, and **PostgreSQL** to extract structured data from messy webpages — automatically and reliably.

---

## 🎯 What Problem Does This Project Solve?

This system converts **unstructured job advertisement webpages** into **clean, structured data**, including:

- Job title  
- Company name  
- Responsibilities  
- Required skills  
- Qualifications  
- Experience  
- Salary  
- Location  

It then uses LLMs to generate **insights and reports** based on the extracted data.

Traditional scraping cannot handle unstructured text effectively.  
LLMs *can* — and this project uses them in a controlled, typed, and production‑safe way.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

### 🕷️ Crawl4AI
- Crawls job advertisement webpages efficiently  
- Supports asynchronous crawling  
- Integrates with LLMs for extraction  
- Fast and reliable for large‑scale scraping  

### 🦙 Ollama
- Runs LLMs locally for **privacy** and **zero cost**  
- Extracts structured data from unstructured text with asyncio to speed up the extraction process.
- Generates insights and reports

### 🐘 PostgreSQL
- Stores extracted job data  
- Supports complex data types (e.g., lists)  
- Reliable, scalable, and production‑ready  

### 🧩 Pydantic
- Ensures extracted data matches strict schemas  
- Validates types before inserting into the database  

### ⚡ Asyncio
- Enables concurrent crawling and extraction  
- Significantly speeds up processing time

## 🛠️ Installation and Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Langchain_JobResearch.git
cd Langchain_JobResearch

# install dependences
uv sync

## Set up your .env file:
POSTGRES_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
OLLAMA_EXTRACTION_MODEL = your_ollama_llm_model # recommend to use nuextract:latest
OLLAMA_SUMMARIZATION_MODEL = your_ollama_llm_model # recommend to use phi4-mini:latest

## Usage
uv run main.py
type the keyword(e.g. AI) for searching relevant jobs.
